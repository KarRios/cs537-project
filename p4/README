CS 537 Project 4 - Concurrency

4a) Scalable Web Crawler
(Ke Ma)
Implemented a multi-threaded web crawler library, which employs some downloaders that download pages from the Internet, and some parsers that parse the downloaded pages looking for links to unvisited pages.


4b) xv6 Threads
(Chang Wang)
In this project, I added xv6 kernel threads. First, I implemented two system calls: clone() and join(). And I also modified some existing functions such as wait(), exit() and growproc(). At last I used clone() and join() to build a small thread library, with thread_create(), thread_join(), lock_init(), lock_acquire() and lock_release() functions.
