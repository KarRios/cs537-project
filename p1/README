1a) Text Sorting
Implemented a simple sorting program to sort lines in a input text file according to their i-th words. Used 3-way string quicksort as the base sorting algorithm.

Added a simple system call getprocs() to the xv6 kernel, which returns the number of processes that exist in the system at the time of the call.
