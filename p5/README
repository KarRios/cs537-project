5a) File System Checker
(Ke Ma)
Implemented a file system checker for the xv6 file system image, which reads through the image and determines the consistency of inodes, bitmaps, directories and data.

5b) The Small File Optimization
(Chang Wang)
In this project, we changed the existing xv6 file system to add high-performance support for small files. The basic idea is if we have a small file, instead of allocating a data block for it, we just store the data itself inside the inode to speed up access to the small file as well as saving some disk space.
